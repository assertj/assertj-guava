Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AssertJ assertions!  
We appreciate your effort and to make sure that your pull request is easy to review, we ask you to make note of the following guidelines:

* Use **[AssertJ code Eclipse formatting preferences](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/blob/master/src/ide-support/assertj-eclipse-formatter.xml)** (for Idea users, it is possible to import it)
* Write complete Javadocs on each assertion methods including a code example.
* Write one JUnit test class for each assertion method with the following naming convention : `<AssertClass>_<assertion>_Test`. 
* Unit tests method naming convention is underscore based (like python) and not camel case, we find it is much readable for long test names!
* Successful assertion unit test method name must start with : `should_pass_...`.
* Failing assertion unit test method name must start with : `should_fail_...`.
* If possible, add a (fun) code example in [assertj-examples](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-examples) and use it in the javadoc. 

Example : 

Since `OptionalAssert` has three assertions: `isPresent`, `isAbsent`, `contains`, we have three test classes:
* `OptionalAssert_isPresent_Test`
* `OptionalAssert_isAbsent_Test`
* `OptionalAssert_contains_Test`

Let's look at `OptionalAssert_contains_Test` tests names:
* `should_pass_when_actual_contains_expected_value`
* `should_fail_if_actual_is_null`
* `should_fail_when_option_does_not_contain_expected_value`
* `should_fail_when_optional_contains_nothing`
